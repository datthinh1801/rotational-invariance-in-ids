# The Impact of Rotational Invariance on Tree- and Deep Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System
> This is the complementary repository of my research paper **The Impact of Rotational Invariance on Tree- and Deep Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System**.  

## Experiment
Download this repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:datthinh1801/rotational-invariance-in-ids.git
```

Change directory to the project repository.
```
cd rotational-invariance-in-ids
```

Install the necessary packages either with `pipenv`.
```
pipenv install
```

Then run the `run_experiment.py` script.
```
python3 src/run_experiment.py
```
